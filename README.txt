The Assistive Self-Balancing Robot was a project completed for the Engineering Senior Design Project (CSE 123A and CSE 123B) during my Senior year in UC Santa Cruz. My group designed and modeled the concept of a self-balancing robot that can be used for assistive applications for disabled and elderly people, such as carrying heavy objects. The robot's main functions included self-balancing and user tracking.
